# LeetCode Executer

Leetcode is a platform for practicing competitive coding problems. 

During the process of coding a solution, one might need to debug to see what is going on with the code.

This process can be tiresome because there is no direct executable that one can execute and debug the code.

This code takes the code and executes is based on input provided.

Thus, you are saved from writing boiler plate code for executing the code.
